# VulScan

## What is VulScan?
* VulScan is a security auxillary tool which helps in * scanning vulnerabilities in a server.
* It aims at providing security to server at low * maintenance cost for Commercial and Enterprise level * projects as well as Individual level project.

<hr/>

## Working of VulScan
* For VulScan to work, needs to be installed on the * particular server
* VulScan works on monitoring and providing information about the vulnerabilities of the Server.

<hr/>

## 2 levels to monitor attacks

### Level 1
* In Level 1, we focus on System tempering.
* In system tempering we look for basic network * configuration files in the system. VulScan application * tries to look for this tempering based on the template * file which has been provided to it by the administrator.
* Based on this, we measure the level of tempering in the system, based on which thegeneral degree of vulnerability is assigned to the system.

### Level 2
* In level 2 we have detailed the set of attacks in a generic Web/Database Server. 
* So when an attack or an attempt for attack is made to the server, server logs the attack in its access log.
* We scan the entire log file to discover signature of vulnerability.
* This log records are compared with the actual signature of attacks.Thus the vulnerability can be scanned and attacks or attempts to attacks can be listed.
* The result of the scanning is brought in three forms
    1. HTML Document
    2. XML Document
    3. TEXT Document
